Overview
STL Data Viewer is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to parse, display, search, edit, and save custom STL (presumably "String Table List" or a similarly named format) files. The application leverages the tkinter library for the GUI and pandas for data manipulation, providing a user-friendly interface for managing multilingual data entries.

Features
File Operations:

Open STL Files: Select and load STL files for viewing and editing.
Save STL Files: Save modifications back to STL format.
Export to CSV: Export data to CSV for external use or analysis.
Data Display:

Treeview Interface: Display data in a tabular format with support for multiple languages.
Search Functionality: Filter displayed records based on user-input search terms.
Edit Entries: Double-click cells to edit their content directly within the GUI.
Language Support:

Multi-language Parsing: Supports parsing of multiple languages as defined in the STL file.
Configurable Languages: Easily adjust which languages to parse and display.




Code Structure
The application is primarily contained within a single Python script, organized into several key sections and functions for clarity and maintainability.

Main Sections:
Imports:

Import necessary modules and libraries.
Utility Functions:

read_bstr: Reads a length-prefixed string from a binary file.
write_bstr: Writes a length-prefixed string to a binary file.
Core Functions:

parse_stl: Parses an STL file and extracts relevant data.
write_stl: Writes data back to an STL file in the correct format.
display_data_gui: Constructs and manages the GUI components.
Event Handlers:

update_treeview: Updates the Treeview based on search criteria.
on_double_click: Handles editing of Treeview entries.
Main Execution:

main: Orchestrates the application flow, including file selection and GUI initialization.
